    "While heavily indebted at the end of war, Belgium had a zero debtor position when war reparations were included, and was even a net creditor under certain assumptions. While Belgium’s inter-government debt declined significantly in the 1920s as a result of repayment and rescheduling, it was eventually forced into default when Germany stopped paying war reparations.",
    "While heavily indebted at the end of war, France had a zero debtor position when war reparations were included, and was even a net creditor under certain assumptions. During the war, France was also a creditor to a number of its close allies. It was eventually forced into default when Germany stopped paying war reparations.",
    "Germany's external debt mirrors the various negotiations over war reparations.",
    "While heavily indebted to the US, the UK was a net creditor. Its net creditor position was partially due to very favorable assumptions on discount rate.",
    "Italy was heavily indebted at the end of war, although it benefitted from bilateral debt reduction over time. Nevertheless, it was eventually forced into default when Germany stopped paying war reparations.",
    "Russia was mainly indebted towards the UK and France and continued to borrow in the post-war period to finance reconstruction. However, it was not awarded reparation payments. Over time, it repaid some of its debt.",
    "The US was the main financier of the allied countries during and after the war, but also lent to Russia. Its creditor position was partially due to very favorable assumptions on discount rate.",

    "By the end of WWI, Germany had not accumulated external inter-government debt, but allied countries had become heavily indebted to the US and the UK, the only two countries with a net creditor position. The US considered that its claims on other allied countries were on commercial terms and should not be cancelled on political grounds.",
    "By 1920, allied countries incurred further inter-government debts to help cover the costs of reconstruction. The 1919 Versailles treaty—which ultimately would not be ratified by the US—only resulted an agreement on the principle of war reparations to be paid by Germany but not on the amounts. These were to be decided by an independent commission.",
    "By 1923, inter-government debt from allied countries towards other allied countries had nearly doubled compared to 1918. France’s net debtor position had more than tripled.",
    "By 1921, the independent commission set up by the Versailles Treaty to determine Germany’s reparation obligations came up with the so-called London Schedule, under which Germany would owe 132 million German Marks to allied countries, thereby dramatically changing the next external government balance of Belgium and France.",
    "Out of the 132 million mark for reparation, the London schedule only foresaw immediate issuance of two bonds (A and B) worth 50 million mark. The remainder would only be issued if these obligations were to be met. Even the lower amounts of war reparation would result in France turning into a net creditor of inter-government debt.  Germany did not agree with the London Schedule, however, and only made very limited reparation payments.",
    "By 1930, the debt of certain allied countries—particularly Belgium and Italy—toward other allied countries was significantly reduced as a result of repayments and negotiated debt reductions.",
    "During 1924-1929, following the chaos caused by hyperinflation and in response to its evasion of reparation payments, Germany was placed under supervision of a reparation commission. For five years Germany paid reparations under the Dawes Plan schedule. The UK and France used reparations receipts from Germany to service their American war debts. In 1929, the Young Plan replaced the Dawes plan and involved a substantial reduction of Germany’s reparation obligations. Despite this reduction, and in the context of the 1931 financial crisis, Germany would default on its reparation obligations, resulting in a cascade of defaults.",
    "Among the points of contention between negotiating parties were the financial assumptions. For instance, since debt calculations were made on a flow term, the discount rate was an important factor. Using the same discount rate on allied debt as for war reparations owed by Germany would have lowered the debt owed to allied countries.",
