                                    World War I (WWI) was one of the deadliest war and inflicted heavy costs and losses on some 
                                    of the belligerents. Taxation only partially financed massive military expenditures. 
                                    An important share of military expenditures and—in the post-war era—of reconstruction costs 
                                    was financed through bilateral government loans. After the United States entered the war, it
                                    provided much of the needed financing, either directly through US Treasury advances or mediated
                                    through the United Kingdom. At the end of the war, the US and the UK were the only two 
                                    net creditor countries. By then, Germany had accumulated very limited external debt.

                            WWI was the first war where the notion of war reparations was introduced to finance costs
                            associated with inflicted losses. The losses were very different amongst countries. Human
                            losses (and associated war pension costs) were particularly severe for Germany, France, 
                            Belgium, the UK. Belgium and France suffered the heaviest physical damages. In addition, 
                            Germany had destroyed large sways of industrial capacity in Belgium and the North of France, 
                            preventing effective competition with the Ruhr industries.

                            The amount of war reparations owed by Germany was to be negotiated taking several factors 
                            into account: (i) the estimation of physical costs; (ii) the possible inclusion of war-related
                            pensions; (iii) Germany’s repayment capacity; (iv) linkages between the repayment of war 
                            reparations and of interallied debts; and (v) the existence of enforcement mechanisms for the
                            repayment. Different perspectives and priorities among allied countries led to several rounds
                            of negotiations over war reparations. Overtime, the lack of agreement on a substantial 
                            reduction of inter-related debt pave the way for bilateral defaults and contributed to the
                            great depression.

                                    1918—Armistice: the UK failed to convince the US to cancel war-related interallied debts
                                    on the ground it was political debt. The US considered it as commercial debt to be repaid
                                    in full.

                                    1919—The Versailles Treaty: no agreement was reached on the amount of war reparations. 
                                    While Keynes and the US had argued for lower amounts that could be more easily repaid, 
                                    the UK succeeded in including pensions. The Treaty included a provision to set up a war 
                                    reparation commission to finalize the amount of war reparations. To enforce and guarantee peace,
                                    a security pact was agreed between France and the UK, but was withdrawn when the US Senate 
                                    later rejected the Treaty.

                                    1921—The London Schedule: The war reparation commission settled in for an amount of 132 million
                                    German Marks with two series of bonds (the so-called A and B bonds) totaling 50 million German 
                                    Marks issued immediately, and a third category of interest-free bonds (C bonds) in the amount 
                                    of 82 million German Marks which were to be issued only when it could be shown that prior 
                                    obligations could be met. The A and B bonds corresponded to what Keynes had regarded as a 
                                    feasible maximum payment in 1919.

                                    of reparation payments with led to the Franco-Belgian Ruhr occupation, Germany was placed 
                                    under American receivership. For five years Germany paid reparations with American money that
                                    returned to the US as the UK and France used the reparations receipts to service their American
                                    war debts. This scheme was ultimately abandoned by the US.

                                    part of the war debt payments to the US, and de facto linked to interallied war debt payments
                                    thereafter. Part of the payments were, however, made conditional to Germany’s budget stance.

                                    the signature of the Young agreement, and the subsequent irregular repayment of interallied debt,
                                    another attempt was made in Lausanne to substantially reduce interallied debts and war 
                                    reparations, but was ultimately not ratified by the US. The rejection of the Lausanne agreement
                                    was compounded by Germany’s repudiation of Dawes and Young’s bonds, and ultimately caused a series 
                                    of defaults in interallied debts.

                            An important dimension of discussions around debt amounts was related to discount rate 
                            assumptions since bilateral government loans were not securitized or valued in the market.
                            Simulations show that different discount rate assumptions would have resulted in significant
                            different outcomes, altering the balance in the discussions.
